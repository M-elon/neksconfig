# nek's config
This is a personalised config that I wanted to make public.

This config is designed for Windows but I'm not sure if it will work on other operating systems.

This is designed to be ran on systems with a quadcore or better CPU.
Running this on a dual core WILL cause problems. Edit cfg/gfx.cfg to your own personal ways.
